The first paper from my PhD just got published online in the Planetary Science Journal! Titled "Atmospheric loss during giant impacts: mechanisms and scaling of near- and far-field loss", we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to determine the mechanisms by which a planet's atmosphere can be removed during planetâ€“planet collisions know as giant impacts. Read more about it on my **[Research](/research/giant-impacts/)** page, or check it out online [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/add929/meta)!

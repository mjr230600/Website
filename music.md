# Music

In my spare time, I am an avid performing musician! Whilst I keep my love of jazz piano and occassional guitar as a hobby (and to bi-annual performances with the University of Bristol Earth Science department band!), I am also a percussionist with **[The Cory Band](https://coryband.com/)** – one of the world's top-ranked brass bands that, whilst being a majority amateur organisation, performs at a professional level. This prestigious position has taken me across the world, with a tour to South Korea and regular performances across Europe in some of the world's most prestigious venues, including The Royal Albert Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall, KKL Luzern, Malmö Live, and Stavanger Konserthus.

I am very keen to get involved in other freelance musical ventures, so if you are an orchestra, musical theatre group, or other ensemble looking for a percussionist, please don't hesitate to get in touch at <a href="mailto:matthewroche@hotmail.co.uk" style="color: #1E90FF;">matthewroche@hotmail.co.uk</a>!
